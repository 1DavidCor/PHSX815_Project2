# PHSX815_Project2

So, we need to sample from a distribution with at least one configurable parameter for Project #2 to complicate the experiment from Project #1. I want to choose a distribution with an adjustable parameter (to be determined via user input) such that the output is an integer. This integer value will be set as # of degrees of freedom (DOF) used to generate chi-square distributions from randomly generated standard normal distributions. I decided to use the binomial distribution with adjustable parameters n (sample size), and p (probability of succes). Previously, teh Project #1 code only produced one chi-square distribution at a time. Project #2 is now capable of repeating this experiment for a certain number of experiments (as determined by the user), each with a new DOF determined from the binomial distribution. The analysis i.e. calculating the mean and variance of the chi-square distribution was kept the same. However, now the calculation is repeated N times, or once for each randomly generated chi-square distribution.
