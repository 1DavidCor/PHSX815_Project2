# PHSX815_Project2

So, we need to sample from a distribution with at least one configurable parameter for Project #2. to complicate the experiment from Project #1. I want to choose a distribution with an adjustable parameter (to be determined via user input) such that the output is an integer. This integer value will be set as # of degrees of freedom (DOF) in line 60. What distribution would be best suited for this purpose? Currently, this code only produces one chi-square distribution at a time. How can I modify this code to repeat for a certain number of experiments, each with a new DOF determined from the new distribution? What sort of analysis would make the most sense for a set of chi-square distributions with different # of degrees of freedom? I was also having trouble getting this code to run with the default settings (lines 23-33). Maybe you can help me figure out why?
